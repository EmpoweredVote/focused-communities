# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Give every compass topic a home where citizens can understand all five perspectives and debate productively — without tribal noise.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation + Schema

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Foundation]: Use moderation_status enum (NOT deleted_at) in all RLS USING clauses — avoids Supabase soft-delete deadlock bug #1941
- [Foundation]: Display name must be snapshotted at post time (trigger approach recommended over application layer)
- [Foundation]: connect.* schema requires explicit GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA connect TO anon, authenticated
- [Foundation]: (SELECT auth.uid()) not bare auth.uid() in all RLS policy expressions — statement-level caching
- [Foundation]: All schema changes via Supabase CLI migrations only — no manual console changes
- [Phase 5]: Framer components must use absolute URLs for /api/* calls (self-contained, no direct Supabase queries)
- [Phase 5]: Skip Supabase Realtime in v1; use React Query refetchInterval polling instead
- [Phase 6]: Cache-Control: private, no-store on all auth-touching routes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 5]: Framer + Express auth token flow is unverified — how Framer production frontend passes Supabase JWT to Express write endpoints needs research before Phase 5 planning. Flag: run /gsd:research-phase before planning Phase 5.
- [Pre-Phase 3]: Confirm connect.communities can reference inform.compass_topics via FK (cross-schema JOIN). If not, use denormalized topic_id UUID with no FK constraint. Verify during Phase 3 implementation.
